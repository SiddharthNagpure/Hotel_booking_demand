# Hotel_booking_demand

## Context
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

The data contains "bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017".

The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

The data was downloaded and cleaned by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday during the week of February 11th, 2020.

## Task
Can we predict the possibility of a booking for a hotel based on the previous_cancellation as the target?
